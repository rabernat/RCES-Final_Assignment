# Research Computing for the Earth Sciences: Final Project

## Scientific Question/Hypothesis

Scientific Question: Has daily temperature variability increased anywhere in the world?

Around the world, we hear more and more people saying colloquially that the weather is getting weirder. However, recent analyses suggest that daily temperature variability has not increased significantly in recent decades and that most sense of "weirder weather" can be explained by shifts in the mean temperature. We strive to test additional metrics in order to determine whether or not this conclusion is robust.

## Summary of Analysis

In this analysis, I will generate a set of figures demonstrating the trend in frequency of flipping between positive and negative extremes in daily temperature maximums over the last 40 years. I will also calculate the trend of the integrated positive (negative) departure for maximum (minimum) daily temperatures for each season in order to measure how much more intense heating events and cooling events have become, collectively. Each of these analyses will be presented for the four meteorological seasons (DJF, MAM, JJA, SON).
